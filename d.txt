I have nothing to write here, so here's a nice joke:


A man in the locker room of an upscale gym in NYC answers a cell phone and puts it on speaker while he dresses.
Everyone else in the room stops to listen.
 
Man: Hello?

Woman: Hi honey, it’s me. Are you at the club? 

Man: Yes. 

Woman: I’m out shopping and found a beautiful leather coat. It’s only $2,000 – is it OK if I buy it? 

Man: Sure, go ahead if you like it that much.

Woman: I also stopped by that new Lexus dealership and saw one of 
the new models I really like – it’s on an opening special. 

Man: How much? 

Woman: $90,000. 

Man: Wow! OK, but for that price I want it with all the options. 

Woman: Great! Oh, and one more thing… I was just talking to Jamie and 
found out that the house we wanted to buy last year is back on the market… 
they’re asking $980,000 for it. Remember it was well over a million when we looked at it? 

Man: I dunno. Make an offer for $900,000 and they’ll probably take it. If not, 
we can go the extra $80,000 if that’s what you really want. 

Woman: OK. I’ll see you later! I love you so much! 

Man: I love you too. 

The man hangs up. The other men in the locker room were staring at him in astonishment, mouths wide open. 
The man turns around and says, “Anyone know whose phone this is?"

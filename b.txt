edit: Here's another joke:

A Texan walks into an Irish pub and says:
"I heard y'all Irishmen really like your Guiness, you know what, I'm gonna give 500 American dollars to the guy who can drink 10 pints of Guiness in a go. Does anybody accept?"
The pub falls dead silent and one gentleman even gets up and leaves. Said gentleman returns 10 minutes later and asks the Texan "Hey, is your bet still standing?" "Yes", replies the Texan.
The gentleman then tells the bartender to pour him 10 pints of Guiness and to the bewilderment of everyone including the Texan, finishes it in one go.
The Texan then asks him "Don't mind me asking, but where were you those 10 minutes?". The man replies, "Well, I went to the pub across the street. I had to know if I could actually do it".
